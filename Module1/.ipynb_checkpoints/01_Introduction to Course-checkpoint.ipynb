    "- Management of Enterprise Analytics: This certificate is for people who will be managing or working with Data Science teams and need an understanding of the key management issues such as privacy and security and a survey of the core data science techniques.\n",
    "- Data Science: This certificate covers the key statistical methods of Data Science, the technologies for analyzing small and massive distributed datasets, and the inner workings of machine learning algorithms, all using hands-on tools and exercises in Python.  The certificate includes four courses: Foundations of Data Science, Statistics for Data Science, Big Data Tools and Machine Learning.\n",
    "- Artificial Intelligence: This certificate shares the Machine Learning course from the Data Science certificate and adds two additional courses, Deep Learning (this course), which extends the introduction to Deep Learning and TensorFlow from the Machine Learning course into specific Deep Learning architectures and their applications; and Intelligent Agents & Reinforcement Learning which covers search and learning techniques for problems (such as game-playing) where there isn't a single best strategy but some moves are likely better than others and there is occasional feedback that the strategy seems to be working well or not."
